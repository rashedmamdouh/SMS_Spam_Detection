## Project Mission: Spam Message Classification ##

Spam detection is a crucial application of Machine Learning online, particularly in email services where messages are automatically flagged as 'Junk Mail.' In this mission, we leverage the Naive Bayes algorithm to create a model capable of classifying SMS messages as spam or not based on training data. The intuition behind spam messages includes words like 'free,' 'win,' 'cash,' and excessive capitalization and exclamation marks.

This project involves binary classification, categorizing messages as 'Spam' or 'Not Spam,' and is supervised learning since we use labeled data to train the model.
